This is a very simple attempt at generating a swara pattern in South Indian Carnatic Classical Music. 

This program does the following 
- takes a single pattern as input from the user
- extrapolates it
- and shows the full pattern as output.

The output includes the aarohanam (ascending notes) and avarohanam(descending notes).

The avarohanam is the mirror image of aarohanam.

Execution

From the project folder, execute the following command.

```python ./__main.py```
